# Crowdstrike
Used to fetch maintenance/uninstallation token from API with aid retrieved from registry. This would be useful for those devices which went off from console because of "certain reasons".
You require an API token from falcon console with scope "Sensor update policies" for this. (https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/api-clients-and-keys/clients/)
for now, token needs to be saved within the script.
